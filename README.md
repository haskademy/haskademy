# `haskademy`

Haskell can be an intimidating language to learn.
As a product and favored tool of academia, a lot of the material around Haskell can be difficult to understand for beginners and industrial programmers.
Fortunately, there exists a "golden road" to learning Haskell -- if you can find it.
Haskademy is a model for learning to be productive with Haskell quickly.

Haskademy uses a variety of learning materials to bring people from 0 functional programming experience to competent professionals.

# Course Structures

## Community

The Community course structure is designed for people interested in Haskell, but don't have professional support or time to invest in a more accelerated course.
It consists of three overlapping segments, where people from the more advanced segments participate in teaching the beginners.
Each segment runs for twelve weeks, so the total running time of the course is 36 weeks.

A single knowledgeable Haskell programmer can start running the course with the first segment, and continue to teach all three segments.
By the time the students have completed a segment, they will be capable of teaching the next wave of students while also learning the material in the next segment.
The rolling structure helps students reinforce the prior material while gaining valuable Haskell teaching and training experience.

### Segment 1

Learning materials:

- [Haskell Programming from First Principles](http://haskellbook.com/)

This segment consists of the first 18 chapters of "Haskell Programming from First Principles," along with selected exercises and readings.

### Segment 2

Learning materials:

- [Haskell Programming from First Principles](http://haskellbook.com/)

This segment consists of chapters 19-31 of "Haskell Programming from First Principles," along with a personalized final project with supervision.

### Segment 3

Learning materials:

- [Parallel and Concurrent Programming in Haskell](https://simonmar.github.io/pages/pcph.html)

This segment works through the book "Parallel and Concurrent Programming in Haskell."

## Boot Camp

The Bootcamp structure is designed around a 60 hour per week pace.
Students receive intensive, hands-on instruction from leaders.
